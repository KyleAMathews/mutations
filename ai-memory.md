# AI Memory File

## Instructions for AI
1. Always add new entries at the top under the "Timeline" section
2. Use ISO 8601 timestamps (from the provided current time)
3. Format each entry as:
   ```markdown
   ### YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ
   - Main topic/decision
   - Details and context
   - Any important code changes
   - Next steps or open questions
   ```
4. Keep entries factual and concise
5. Include links to relevant files and line numbers when applicable
6. Tag entries with categories in brackets: [setup], [feature], [refactor], [test], [docs]

## Timeline

### 2024-12-23T08:33:30-07:00 [feature] [test]
- Added support and tests for RegExp and BigInt handling
- Special handling for RegExp objects to maintain method bindings
- Tests cover:
  - RegExp objects and arrays of RegExp
  - BigInt values and operations
  - Mixed RegExp and BigInt in complex objects
- All 22 tests now passing

### 2024-12-23T08:29:14-07:00 [docs]
- Created this AI memory file
- Purpose: Track progress, decisions, and context across sessions
- Will be updated in reverse chronological order

### 2024-12-23T08:07:44-07:00 [test]
- Fixed final test issues with array splice operations
- Updated test expectations to correctly handle array extension cases
- All 19 tests now passing

### 2024-12-23T08:04:47-07:00 [feature] [test]
- Added comprehensive test suite for proxy system
- New tests cover:
  - Array operations (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, sort)
  - Nested data structures
  - Set and Map handling
  - Deep object mutations
  - Edge cases and special types
- Fixed Set/Map method handling by binding methods to original objects

### 2024-12-23T08:03:56-07:00 [refactor]
- Integrated proxy-compare library for efficient change tracking
- Replaced custom proxy implementation with battle-tested solution
- Added proper handling for array operations and nested objects

### 2024-12-23T07:59:07-07:00 [setup]
- Initial project setup
- Created core files:
  - proxy.ts: Proxy-based change tracking
  - transaction.ts: Transaction system
  - collection.ts: Collection management
- Set up TypeScript configuration and build system
- Added vitest for testing

### 2024-12-23T08:35:00-07:00 [feature] [test]
- Fixed initialization of delta operations in proxy to properly track all mutation types
- Improved delta reset logic to correctly clear state after emitting changes
- Enhanced Set and Map handling with proper mutation tracking
- All tests now passing including complex cases like nested objects, arrays, and special types

### 2024-12-23T08:35:00-07:00 [docs]
- Updated mutation tracking system to work correctly for:
  - Simple property changes
  - Nested object mutations
  - Array operations (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice)
  - Special types (RegExp, BigInt)
  - Set and Map operations

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Implement transaction support for batching multiple mutations
2. Add schema validation for mutations
3. Create React integration hooks
4. Add documentation and examples
